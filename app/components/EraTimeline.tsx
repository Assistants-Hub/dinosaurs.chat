                        The Cretaceous saw continents drift further. Flowering plants flourished, while massive herbivores like Argentinosaurus roamed. The reign ended with a bang â€“ a giant asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.

My powerful jaws gnash with anticipation, a row of serrated daggers ready to tear flesh.  With a deafening roar that shakes the very trees, I charge forward, a whirlwind of teeth and fury.  Nothing escapes the terror that is Tyrannosaurus Rex!"}

                        This was a golden age for dinosaurs. Lush forests thrived under warm, humid skies as Pangaea continued to break apart. Giants like Brachiosaurus emerged, making it a time of impressive diversity and colossal creatures.

There's no stopping a Stegosaurus on a mission for tasty plants!"}
